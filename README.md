# Mystery Word (AKA, "Hangman")

This repository is for another assignment from The Iron Yard in Durham, NC. This assignment was the first multi-day assignment given over the weekend, with the expectation that this project would be completed before midnight on Sunday night/Monday morning.

This game works as you would expect the classic game of Hangman to work, minus the imagery because I am not a skilled ASCII artist. The computer will first prompt you to choose a difficulty, from which the mystery word will be chosen randomly. The player has 8 guesses to figure out the word. If more than 8 guesses are used, the player loses the game. If the player guesses a correct letter, it will be displayed in the output in the corresponding position or positions. Once all letters are guessed, the full word is revealed and the player has won.

Please run mystery_word.py with Python3 to play. Thanks and enjoy!
