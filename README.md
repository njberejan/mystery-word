Hi! Welcome to the ReadMe file for the Mystery Word homework assignment.

This game works as you would expect the classic game of Hangman to work, minus the imagery because I am not a skilled ASCII artist. The computer will first prompt you to choose a difficulty, from which the mystery word will be chosen randomly. The player has 8 guesses to figure out the word. If more than 8 guesses are used, the player loses the game. If the player guesses a correct letter, it will be displayed in the output in the corresponding position or positions. Once all letters are guessed, the full word is revealed and the player has won.

Please note, I did turn to stack overflow for assistance with the function which reveals the guessed letter as I could not figure out how to get it to display the letter if there were multiple instances of the guessed letter in a word. Someone provided the code for me based on what I had. It works, but I'm not sure why and so if we could go over it at some point I would appreciate it. The rest of the code was written by me (with some assistance from Blake and Bryce.)

Although I have pushed three iterations of the file mystery_word.py to the github page, please run mystery_word.py as this is the final version. The test file is still a complete mystery to me and so it's just a copy of the template provided by Bryce, with a few changes where I was trying to get it to work with my code. If we could go over this process again at a later date I would appreciate that as well.

Thanks and enjoy!
